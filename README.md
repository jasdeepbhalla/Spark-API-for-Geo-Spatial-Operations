###Geo Spatial Operations on Hadoop Distributed File System
* Developed Spark API for Geo Spatial operations such as Geometric Union, Geometric Convex hull, Geometric Farthest Pair, Geometric Closest Pair and Spatial Range Query. Designed algorithms to implement these Geospatial Operations.

* Used HDFS for sending and receiving data to Apache Spark. Created multi node (1 Master and 4 Slaves) cluster using Hadoop to run the spark based queries.
